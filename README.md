2.  Browse all open issues with the label `looking-for-hackers` or `creating-new-team`.
3.  If you find a team with an idea that excites you, start engaging with the team. You can just comment in the issue. You can reference your issue from step 1 here, so that the team can learn a bit more about you.
4.  When you found a team, close your issue so that others know you have found a team.
